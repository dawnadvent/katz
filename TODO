In case you want to help, here is a list of things that still need to
be done.

TODO:
- write tests
- improve packet buffer handling (recvmsg/sendmsg)
- refactor - some of the code is a bit messy...
- document - some of the code misses documentation...
- improve timer handling (see comments in code)
- cope with sequence number overflow/rotation

MAYBE:
- determine PMTU and set packet size accordingly (see comments in
  code)
- change bandwidth limit on the fly

Also look for TODO/XXX comments in the source.
